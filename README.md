**Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary Tumors and PDX-Derived Organoid Models**
=========================================================================================

This repository analyzes genomic and gene expression changes across primary tumors and various passages of PDX-derived organoid samples.

This project was conducted in collaboration with **Dr. David Solit** at **MSKCC** and **Dr. Michael Shen** at **Columbia University** to develop organoid models of bladder cancer. Prior research from our laboratory demonstrated that commonly used bladder cancer cell lines do not fully represent the biological and genomic diversity of human disease.

Through this collaboration, we developed a novel methodology for establishing organoid models from both patient-derived tumors and previously established PDX models. These models were genomically characterized at both the **DNA** and **transcriptome** levels. This work was published in _Cell_, and the resulting organoid models have become a key resource for our broader research program.
